# react-native-ruler

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-ruler.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-ruler)

üìè A devtool for measuring pixel dimensions on your React Native screens

![iOS Example](./demo.gif)

This is a proof of concept I threw together on a flight. Eventual plans are to integrate within the devtools menu, support rotating the device, allow the bars to be on any of the 4 sides of the device, etc..

Happy to take PRs or suggestions.

## Getting Started

### Installing

`npm install react-native-ruler`

### Usage

```js
// first, import the component
import { RNRuler } from 'react-native-ruler';

// then drop it on any screen in your app (or in the root)
<RNRuler />;
```

-   Tap the bottom right corner of the ruler (or two-finger tap the bar) to swap between axis
